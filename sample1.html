<p>David Heinemeier Hansson announced today that RoR will be dropping support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, and everything else that isn't Quasi-Hardcoded Flat-file NoSQL. This new format is based upon a file that is require'd each time the application is launched that simply has a Hash and an Array that should hold pretty much any data that exists for a reason.</p>
<p>David spoke to RO about this major change, saying "Yeah, see, I'm trendy, and this is trendy because it isn't enterprise ready or anything like that. I've made 500 grand off it already."</p>
<p>Google is expected to make the jump by this time next year.</p>
